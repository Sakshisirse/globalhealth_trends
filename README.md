**Global Health Indicators Dashboard (2000â€“2023)**
This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global health indicators across countries and regions. 
It highlights key trends, disparities, and correlations in health outcomes such as life expectancy, infant mortality, vaccination coverage, disease prevalence, and GDP per capita.

**ðŸ“Š Key Insights**
**GDP vs. Life Expectancy** Weak correlation across all regions (minimal trendline slopes). 
Higher GDP per capita does not consistently lead to longer life expectancy. 
Germany shows the diminishing returns of wealth on longevity, with the highest GDP per capita but only mid-range life expectancy. 
China and Australia achieve high life expectancy at substantially lower GDP levels than Germany. 
The USA has one of the highest GDP per capita levels but ranks low in life expectancy compared to peer countries.

**Regional Disparities Africa:** Highest infant mortality and disease prevalence despite economic growth â†’ wealth not translating into health. 
Asia: Lowest infant mortality and moderate disease prevalence, showing the impact of effective public health interventions
Oceania vs. Europe: Similar vaccination coverage but differing infant mortality and disease prevalence â†’ outcomes shaped by health systems and societal factors.
